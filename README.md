A Static Pycon-Israel-2018 website
==================================

This is an adapted mirroring of the Pycon Israel 2018
website. The original website was a Django app, ran on
Heroku.

The `2018` folder here is intended to be put somewhere
on a website, so that the URL `/2018/` points to it.

Specific explanations about the steps executed to get
from the running website to its frozen version here
are provided in each commit in this repo -- each commit
represents a step.
